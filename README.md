This project investigates an automated machine-learning pipeline to detect lithium plating in lithium-ion batteries using synthetic data generated via PyBaMM. Differential-capacity–based features were extracted and used for clustering and classification to distinguish plated and non-plated battery behavior, with a focus on battery safety and thermal runaway prevention.
